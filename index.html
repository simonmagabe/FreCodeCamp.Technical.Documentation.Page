            <h3>What is Apex?</h3>
            <p>
                Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that
                allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on
                Salesforce servers in conjunction with calls to the API. Using syntax
                that looks like Java and acts like database stored procedures, Apex
                enables developers to add business logic to most system events,
                including button clicks, related record updates, and Visualforce pages.
                Apex code can be initiated by Web service requests and from triggers on
                objects.
            </p>
            <p>You can add Apex to most system events.</p>

                <p>
                    Apex provides built-in support for common Lightning Platform idioms,
                    including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Data manipulation language (DML) calls, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and
                        DELETE, that include built-in DmlException handling
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inline Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) and Salesforce Object
                        Search Language (SOSL) queries that return lists of sObject records
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Looping that allows for bulk processing of multiple records at a
                        time
                    </li>
                    <li>Locking syntax that prevents record update conflicts</li>
                    <li>
                        Custom public API calls that can be built from stored Apex methods
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Warnings and errors issued when a user tries to edit or delete a
                        custom object or field that is referenced by Apex
                    </li>

                <h3>Easy to use</h3>
                <p>
                    Apex is based on familiar Java idioms, such as variable and expression
                    syntax, block and conditional statement syntax, loop syntax, object
                    and array notation. Where Apex introduces new elements, it uses syntax
                    and semantics that are easy to understand and encourage efficient use
                    of the Lightning Platform. Therefore, Apex produces code that is both
                    succinct and easy to write.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Data focused</h3>
                <p>
                    Apex is designed to thread together multiple query and DML statements
                    into a single unit of work on the Salesforce server. Developers use
                    database stored procedures to thread together multiple transaction
                    statements on a database server in a similar way. Like other database
                    stored procedures, Apex does not attempt to provide general support
                    for rendering elements in the user interface.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Rigorous</h3>
                <p>
                    Apex is a strongly typed language that uses direct references to
                    schema objects such as object and field names. It fails quickly at
                    compile time if any references are invalid. It stores all custom
                    field, object, and class dependencies in metadata to ensure that they
                    are not deleted while required by active Apex code.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Hosted</h3>
                <p>
                    Apex is interpreted, executed, and controlled entirely by the
                    Lightning Platform.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Multitenant aware</h3>
                <p>
                    Like the rest of the Lightning Platform, Apex runs in a multitenant
                    environment. So, the Apex runtime engine is designed to guard closely
                    against runaway code, preventing it from monopolizing shared
                    resources. Any code that violates limits fails with easy-to-understand
                    error messages.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Easy to test</h3>
                <p>
                    Apex provides built-in support for unit test creation and execution.
                    It includes test results that indicate how much code is covered, and
                    which parts of your code could be more efficient. Salesforce ensures
                    that all custom Apex code works as expected by executing all unit
                    tests prior to any platform upgrades.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Versioned</h3>
                <p>
                    You can save your Apex code against different versions of the API.
                    This enables you to maintain behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apex is included in Performance Edition, Unlimited Edition, Developer
                    Edition, Enterprise Edition, and Database.com.

            <h1>Apex Development Process</h1>
            <p>
                To develop Apex, get a Developer Edition account, write and test your
                code, then deploy your code.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can run Apex in a production org, a developer org, or a sandbox org.
                You can develop Apex in a developer org or a sandbox org, but not in a
                production org.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you have your developer account, there are many resources
                available to you for learning about Apex
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several development environments for developing Apex code. The
                Developer Console and the Salesforce extensions for Visual Studio Code
                allow you to write, test, and debug your Apex code. The code editor in
                the user interface enables only writing code and doesn’t support
                debugging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Testing is the key to successful long-term development and is a critical
                component of the development process. We strongly recommend that you use
                a test-driven development process, that is, test development that occurs
                at the same time as code development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sandboxes create copies of your Salesforce org in separate environments.
                Use them for development, testing, and training without compromising the
                data and applications in your production org. Sandboxes are isolated
                from your production org, so operations that you perform in your
                sandboxes don’t affect your production org.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you have finished all of your unit tests and verified that your
                Apex code is executing properly, the final step is deploying Apex to
                your Salesforce production organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can include an Apex class or trigger in an app that you are creating
                for AppExchange.

            <h1>Writing Apx</h1>
            <p>
                Apex is like Java for Salesforce. It enables you to add and interact
                with data in the Lightning Platform persistence layer. It uses classes,
                data types, variables, and if-else statements. You can make it execute
                based on a condition, or have a block of code execute repeatedly.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="mini-section" id="variables">
            <h1>Variables</h1>
            <p>
                Local variables are declared with Java-style syntax. As with Java,
                multiple variables can be declared and initialized in a single
                statement.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="mini-section" id="declaring_variable">
            <h1>Declaring Variables</h1>
            <p>Local variables are declared with Java-style syntax. For example:</p>
            <code>
            Integer i = 0;
            String str;
            Boolean x = null;
            Decimal d;
            Date d;
            List<String> strList;
            Set<String> s;
            Map<ID, String> m;
        </code>
            <p>As with Java, multiple variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, using comma
                separation. For example:</p>
            <code>
            Integer i, j, k;
        </code>
        </section>
        <section class="mini-section" id="variable_scope">
            <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
            <p>Variables can be defined at any point in a block, and take on scope from that point forward. Sub-blocks
                can’t redefine a variable name that has already been used in a parent block, but parallel blocks can
                reuse a variable name. For example:</p>
            <code>
            Integer i;
            {
                // Integer i;  This declaration is not allowed
            }

            for (Integer j = 0; j < 10; j++);
            for (Integer j = 0; j < 10; j++);
        </code>
        </section>
        <section class="mini-section" id="case_sensitivity">
            <h1>Case Sensitivity</h1>
            <p>To avoid confusion with case-insensitive SOQL and SOSL queries, Apex is also case-insensitive. This
                means:</p>
            <li>
                Variable and method names are case-insensitive. For example:
                <code>
                Integer I;
                //Integer i;  This would be an error.
            </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                References to object and field names are case-insensitive. For example:
                <code>
                Account a1;
                ACCOUNT a2;
            </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                SOQL and SOSL statements are case- insensitive. For example:
                <code>
                Account[] accts = [sELect ID From ACCouNT where nAme = 'fred'];
            </code>

        <section class="mini-section" id="constant">
            <h1>Constants</h1>
            <p>Apex constants are variables whose values don’t change after being initialized once. Constants can be
                defined using the final keyword.</p>
            <p>The final keyword means that the variable can be assigned at most once, either in the declaration itself,
                or with a static initializer method if the constant is defined in a class. This example declares two
                constants. The first is initialized in the declaration statement. The second is assigned a value in a
                static block by calling a static method.</p>

            <code>
                    public class myCls {
                        static final Integer PRIVATE_INT_CONST = 200;

                        public static Integer calculate() {
                            return 2 + 7;
                        }
                     
                        static {
                            PRIVATE_INT_CONST2 = calculate();
                        }

        <section class="mini-section" id="data_types">
            <h1>Data Types</h1>
            <p>In Apex, all variables and expressions have a data type, such as sObject, primitive, or enum.</p>
            <li>A primitive, such as an Integer, Double, Long, Date, Datetime, String, ID, or Boolean</li>
            <li>An sObject, either as a generic sObject or as a specific sObject, such as an Account, Contact, or
                MyCustomObject__c</li>
            <li>A collection, including:
            <li>A list (or array) of primitives, sObjects, user defined objects, objects created from Apex classes, or
                collections</li>
            <li>A set of primitives</li>
            <li>A map from a primitive to a primitive, sObject, or collection</li>
            </li>
            <li>A typed list of values, also known as an enum</li>
            <li>Objects created from user-defined Apex classes</li>
            <li>Objects created from system supplied Apex classes</li>
            <li>Null (for the null constant, which can be assigned to any variable)</li>
            <p>Methods can return values of any of the listed types, or return no value and be of type Void.</p>
            <p>Type checking is strictly enforced at compile time. For example, the parser generates an error if an
                object field of type Integer is assigned a value of type String. However, all compile-time exceptions
                are returned as specific fault codes, with the line number and column of the error.</p>

        <section class="mini-section" id="if_else_statement">
            <h1>Conditional (If-Else) Statements</h1>
            <p>The conditional statement in Apex works similarly to Java.</p>
            <code>
                if ([Boolean_condition]) 
                    // Statement 1
                else
                    // Statement 2
            </code>
            <p>The else portion is always optional, and always groups with the closest if. For example:</p>
            <code>
                Integer x, sign;
                // Your code
                if (x <= 0) if (x == 0) sign = 0; else sign = -1;
            </code>
            <p>is equivalent to:</p>
            <code>
                Integer x, sign;
                // Your code
                if (x <= 0) {

                    medal_color = 'silver';
                } else if (place == 3) {
                    medal_color = 'bronze';

            <h1>While Loops</h1>
            <p>The Apex while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a particular Boolean condition remains
                true. Its syntax is:</p>
            <code>
                while (condition) {
                    code_block
                }
            </code>
            <p>
                Unlike do-while, the while loop checks the Boolean condition statement before the first loop is
                executed. Consequently, it is possible for the code block to never execute.
            </p>
            <p>As an example, the following code outputs the numbers 1 - 10 into the debug log:</p>
            <code>
                Integer count = 1;

                while (count < 11) {
                    System.debug(count);
                    count++;
                }
            </code>

            <h1>Class Methods</h1>
            <p>To define a method, specify the following:</p>
            <li>Optional: Modifiers, such as <code>public</code> or <code>protected</code>.</li>
            <li>
                Required: The data type of the value returned by the method, such as String or Integer. Use void if the
                method doesn’t return a value.
            </li>
            <li>
                Required: A list of input parameters for the method, separated by commas, each preceded by its data
                type, and enclosed in parentheses ()<code></code>. If there are no parameters, use a set of empty
                parentheses. A method can only have 32 input parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Required: The body of the method, enclosed in braces {}. All the code for the method, including any
                local variable declarations, is contained here.
            </li>
            <p>Use the following syntax when defining a method:</p>
            <code>
                [public | private | protected | global] [override] [static] data_type method_name 
                (input parameters) 
                {
                // The body of the method
                }
